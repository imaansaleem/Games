## Code Explanation for 8 Puzzle using A*

1. **Import the PriorityQueue class from the queue module.**
2. **Define the goal state:** Represented as a tuple of tuples. Each tuple represents a row of the puzzle, and the values represent the numbers in the puzzle cells. In the goal state, the empty cell is represented by 0.
3. **Define the calculate_heuristic function:** Calculates the Manhattan distance heuristic between a given state and the goal state. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of the row and column indices of each number in the state compared to the goal state.
4. **Define the a_star function:** Implements the A* algorithm. It takes a start_state as input and returns the solution path if found or None if no solution is found.
5. **Create an empty priority queue open_set:** To store the states to be explored. Each state is associated with a priority value based on the sum of the g_score (cost from start) and the heuristic value.
6. **Create an empty dictionary came_from:** Stores the parent state for each state in the solution path.
7. **Create a dictionary g_score:** Stores the cost from the start state to each state.
8. **Add the start_state to the open_set:** With a priority value based on the heuristic value.
9. **Enter a loop:** Continues until the open_set is empty.
10. **Get the state with the lowest priority value:** If the state is the goal state, construct and return the solution path by following the came_from dictionary.
11. **Generate successor states:** Using the generate_successors function. It generates new states by swapping the empty cell with its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). Each successor state is associated with a move (direction) to reach that state.
12. **Calculate the new g_score:** For each successor state and check if it's better than the existing g_score. If so, update the g_score, priority value, and add the successor state to the open_set with its priority value. Also, update the came_from dictionary to store the current state as the parent state for the successor state.
13. **If no solution is found:** Return None.
14. **Define the generate_successors function:** Takes a state as input and generates successor states by swapping the empty cell with its neighboring cells. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a move (direction) and the new state.
15. **Test the A* algorithm:** Set the start_state and call the a_star function. If a solution path is found, print each state in the path. If no solution is found, print a message stating so.
